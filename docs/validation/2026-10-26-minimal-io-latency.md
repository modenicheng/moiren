## Current gate state

| Stage | State | Evidence required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Software baseline passed | Archived plan d863d0f; tests/check/driver results below |
| 1 | Software foundation passed | 19 marker tests; no physical observation yet |
| 2 | Software foundation passed | 5 transport, 8 budget and delivery-timing tests |
| 3 | Software propagation passed; hardware pending | Real preparation/prime and 64-frame demand regressions; packet probe pending |
| 4 | Software budget/boundary passed; hardware negotiation pending | Explicit VAD target/capacity tests; live packet shape and native period matrix pending |
| 5 | Software graph/RT regressions passed; physical timing pending | Compiled Input -> Bus -> Output delay regression; physical output timing pending |
| 6 | App settings/rename tests passed; native live validation pending | Persisted transport settings, stale active state, safe rename and held-client tests |
| 7 | Not qualified | Calibrated physical p95, 30-minute and 2-hour PCM/load runs |

No software estimate, VM result or silent counter run qualifies physical E2E.
Missing hardware/calibration is a missing gate and must not be reported as pass.

## Baseline evidence

- `cargo check --locked --workspace --all-targets`: passed before implementation.
- `cargo test --locked -p moiren-engine -p moiren-windows-audio`: passed,
  including clock control, fault and startup matrices. The Windows library
  baseline was 422 passed / 2 ignored; hardware tests remained ignored.
- `pwsh -NoProfile -File driver/vad/test.ps1`: all six host suites passed.
- `pwsh -NoProfile -File driver/vad/build.ps1 -Analyze`: passed with zero
  warnings/errors, INF valid, WDK 10.0.28000.0.
- Host: Windows 11 Pro 10.0.26300; FreeDSP, Realtek and CABLE present.
  No present Moiren VAD on this host. Device defaults were not changed.
- Dedicated VM: zero running VMs; SSH timed out; `vmrun start ... nogui`
  requires the encrypted VM password. No credential search or bypass attempted.
  Target VAD negotiation and driver tests require that VM to be unlocked.
- No calibrated physical recording arrangement has been established.

## Software changes and focused evidence

- Marker generation uses caller buffers; bounded offline correlation rejects
  silence, clipping, truncation, ambiguous matches and invalid limits.
  `latency_marker`: 19 passed; combined with existing `latency`: 29 passed.
  Module-focused strict Clippy passed. Offsets are sample alignment only.
- Transport input budgets independently resolve capacity, prime/servo target,
  watermarks and modeled minimum from complete consumption burst, declared
  delivery gap, jitter and lookahead. Unknown delivery cannot admit a target.
  `transport_budget`: 5 passed; existing `latency_budget`: 8 passed.
- Configured Process Loopback preparation now attaches its requested queue
  before activation. The regression primes after three 480-frame packets at
  target 1024 (below the old 2048 threshold), preserves zero-position FIFO
  semantics and reports no invented native period. One focused test passed.
- Professional process regression reproduced 256-frame prefetch on a 64-frame
  render (RED). Removing the duplicate FIR/prefetch made it consume exactly
  64 frames and preserve every expected sample (GREEN).
- These are software regressions, not measured Windows callback or E2E results.

## Current implementation conclusions

### VAD driver and runtime

- The driver has a working control ABI for capabilities, stable endpoint IDs,
  CREATE/QUERY/REMOVE, gate admission, PCM16/Float32 mono/stereo streams,
  session/epoch fencing, bounded overlapped requests and asynchronous removal.
- The Moiren provider has a production integration path: lifecycle discovery,
  endpoint creation, native PCM workers, playback/microphone virtual
  boundaries, Engine activation gates, cancellation and stale-epoch recovery
  are implemented and covered by host tests.
- VAD is not live-qualified on the current development machine. There is no
  present Moiren VAD endpoint and no calibrated physical measurement chain, so
  live activation and real VAD-vs-Process latency comparison remain open.

### VAD rename

- User rename is supported by the app UI and service.
- The driver has no independent in-place rename IOCTL. The safe implementation
  closes admission, drains the owner, removes the old native child, waits for
  observed `Removed`, then recreates it with the same stable endpoint ID and
  graph binding but the new name.
- During this sequence the UI reports pending/actual/native/Engine-confirmed
  state. Held-client, create-failure and repeated-rename cases are tested;
  desired name is retained if native recreation fails.

### Buffer and latency interpretation

- Process Loopback buffer policy is configurable through persisted app
  settings. Capacity, target, jitter, maximum packet and maximum gap are
  validated before activation and are distinct from physical latency.
- VAD has the same explicit target/capacity model, but low-latency admission
  requires a real packet/gap bound. The driver capability `4800` is a maximum
  packet bound, not proof that every packet is 4800 frames or that the endpoint
  has a 50 ms normal residence.
- Software changes removed the old Process Loopback 2048-frame prime and the
  duplicate professional prefetch. This explains a significant part of the
  observed delay risk, but it cannot establish the remaining Windows callback,
  render queue or physical acoustic/electrical delay.
- It is therefore not yet honest to declare VAD or Process Loopback faster.
  The current software structure gives Process Loopback the clearer short-path
  baseline; VAD may match or beat it only after native packet delivery and
  physical output are measured under identical conditions.

## Remaining execution gates

1. Unlock the target VM or connect an equivalent test machine, run the power
   preflight, install the analyzed/test-signed package, and confirm the present
   VAD endpoints without changing unrelated device defaults.
2. Run the live VAD lifecycle and PCM matrix: endpoint creation, rename with a
   held client, gate close/open, playback and microphone packet shapes, stale
   epoch rejection, drop/silence counters and final removal observation.
3. Add the same packet-size/gap telemetry to Process Loopback and VAD runs;
   sweep candidate targets such as 2048/1024/512/256 Process frames and
   480/240/128/64 VAD packet frames only when the native path admits them.
4. Measure `Input -> Bus -> Output` with a calibrated physical cable or a
   calibrated external dual-channel reference. Record p50/p95/p99/max,
   waveform continuity, drops, underruns, discontinuities and epoch resets.
5. Tune one complete configuration at a time. Reduce target and render queue
   until the first quality failure, then choose the smallest stable target with
   margin. Never hide an underrun by silently increasing the target after the
   run.
6. Run the 30-minute controlled-load experiment for each viable VAD and
   Process configuration. A candidate passes the experimental gate only when
   calibrated p95 plus uncertainty is at most 10 ms and all quality counters
   are zero.
7. Repeat the proposed default in two independent two-hour runs, then update
   the default profile and evidence only if both runs pass. Until then, keep
   the default Compatible behavior and label expert settings experimental.

The `<10 ms` target is not passed by this branch yet. Internal markers,
software queue timestamps, VM lifecycle results and silent-counter tests are
necessary diagnostics but are not physical end-to-end evidence.
